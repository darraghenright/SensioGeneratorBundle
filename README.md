##Introduction

A fork of SensioGeneratorBundle adding the following features:

* Column sorting
* Pagination
* Styling
* etc.

Currently in development. Basic column sorting and pagination added.

##Usage

The package should already be registered in `app/autoload.php` and `app/AppKernel.php`.
If so, just drop the bundle into `vendor/bundles/Sensio/Bundle/GeneratorBundle`.

I should probably rename this if I make many more changes.

More details to follow.
